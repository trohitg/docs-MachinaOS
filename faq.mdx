# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and troubleshooting for MachinaOs.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MachinaOs?">
    MachinaOs is an open-source workflow automation platform inspired by n8n. It lets you create visual workflows that connect AI models, messaging services, devices, and APIs using a drag-and-drop interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is MachinaOs free to use?">
    Yes, MachinaOs is open-source and free to self-host. You only pay for external services you use (AI API calls, cloud hosting, etc.).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between MachinaOs and n8n?">
    MachinaOs is inspired by n8n's node-based approach but focuses on:
    - Deep AI integration (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini with memory)
    - WhatsApp automation
    - Android device control
    - Real-time WebSocket communication

    MachinaOs is built with React and Python, while n8n uses Node.js.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use MachinaOs commercially?">
    Yes, MachinaOs is released under an open-source license. Check the repository for specific license terms.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the system requirements?">
    **Minimum:**
    - 2GB RAM
    - 2 CPU cores
    - 10GB disk space

    **Recommended:**
    - 4GB+ RAM
    - 4+ CPU cores
    - SSD storage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run MachinaOs on Windows?">
    Yes, using Docker Desktop for Windows or WSL2. Native development is also supported with Node.js and Python installed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update MachinaOs?">
    ```bash
    cd MachinaOs
    git pull
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port 3000 is already in use">
    Change the port in your `.env` file:
    ```
    VITE_CLIENT_PORT=3001
    ```
    Then restart the services.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Save and Deploy?">
    - **Save**: Persists your workflow to the database. The workflow is not running.
    - **Deploy**: Activates triggers and starts listening for events. Required for cron schedules, webhooks, and message triggers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my trigger node firing?">
    1. Make sure the workflow is **deployed** (not just saved)
    2. Check if filters are too restrictive
    3. Verify external services are connected (WhatsApp, Android)
    4. Check backend logs for errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I pass data between nodes?">
    Use template variables:
    ```
    {{nodeName.fieldName}}
    ```
    Example: `{{webhookTrigger.body.message}}`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple workflows simultaneously?">
    Yes, each deployed workflow runs independently. Multiple workflows can have triggers active at the same time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug a workflow?">
    1. Use the **Run** button on individual nodes to test them
    2. Check the output panel for node results
    3. Add Python Executor nodes with `print()` statements
    4. Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs -f backend`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where do I add my API keys?">
    Click the **key icon** in the toolbar to open the Credentials panel. Add keys for:
    - OpenAI
    - Anthropic (Claude)
    - Google AI (Gemini)
    - Google Maps
    - Android Remote
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are my API keys secure?">
    Yes, API keys are:
    - Encrypted before storage
    - Stored locally in SQLite
    - Never sent to MachinaOs servers
    - Only transmitted to the respective AI providers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does conversation memory work?">
    The Simple Memory node stores messages in SQLite by session ID. Connect it to an AI Agent's memory handle (diamond shape) to enable multi-turn conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which AI model should I use?">
    | Use Case | Recommended |
    |----------|-------------|
    | General chat | GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet |
    | Complex reasoning | Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4 Turbo |
    | Fast responses | GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Haiku |
    | Long context | Gemini 1.5 Pro |
    | Cost-effective | GPT-3.5 Turbo |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## WhatsApp

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect WhatsApp?">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhooks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's my webhook URL?">
    Local: `http://localhost:3010/webhook/{path}`
    Production: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/{path}`

    Replace `{path}` with the path you set in the Webhook Trigger node.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook returns 404">
    - Verify the workflow is **deployed**
    - Check the path matches exactly (case-sensitive)
    - Ensure backend is running on the correct port
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I secure my webhooks?">
    Use authentication in the Webhook Trigger node:
    - Basic auth (username/password)
    - Bearer token
    - API key header
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy without Docker?">
    Yes, but it's more complex:
    1. Install Node.js 18+ and Python 3.12+
    2. Install dependencies: `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    3. Build frontend: `npm run build`
    4. Run backend: `uvicorn main:app`
    5. Serve frontend with nginx

    Docker is recommended for easier deployment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does hosting cost?">
    MachinaOs can run on a small VPS:
    - DigitalOcean: ~$6/month (1GB RAM)
    - AWS EC2: ~$10/month (t3.micro)
    - Self-hosted: Hardware cost only

    Plus costs for AI API calls and domain/SSL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I backup my data?">
    ```bash
    # Backup SQLite database
    docker cp machinaos-backend-1:/app/data ./backup/

    # Backup WhatsApp session
    docker cp machinaos-whatsapp-1:/app/data ./backup/whatsapp/
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Frontend shows blank page">
    - Check browser console for errors
    - Verify frontend container is running
    - Clear browser cache
    - Check if ports are blocked by firewall
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebSocket connection fails">
    - Verify backend is running

    - Ensure no firewall blocks WebSocket (port 3010)
    - Check CORS settings in .env
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High memory usage">
    - Restart containers: `docker-compose restart`
    - Check for runaway workflows
    - Limit conversation memory window size
