## Key Features

### AI Integration
Connect to 6 AI providers with built-in conversation memory, tool calling, and thinking modes.

- **OpenAI** - GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, o1, o3, o4-mini with response format and reasoning effort
- **Anthropic** - Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku with extended thinking
- **Google** - Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking with multimodal support
- **OpenRouter** - 200+ models via unified API (OpenAI, Claude, Llama, Mistral, and more)
- **Groq** - Ultra-fast inference with Llama, Mixtral, Qwen with reasoning modes
- **Cerebras** - Ultra-fast inference on custom AI hardware
- **AI Agent** - LangGraph agent with tool calling and iterative reasoning
- **Chat Agent** - Conversational agent with skill support for multi-turn chat
- **Simple Memory** - Markdown-based conversation history with long-term vector storage

### WhatsApp Automation
Send and receive WhatsApp messages with event-driven triggers.

- QR code pairing via Go WhatsApp bridge (whatsmeow)
- Message filtering: sender, group, keywords, forwarded status
- Group/sender name persistence for display

### Android Device Control
Automate Android devices via local ADB or remote WebSocket relay.

**17 Service Nodes:**
- System Monitoring: battery, network, system info, location
- App Management: launcher, app list
- Device Automation: WiFi, Bluetooth, audio, device state, screen control, airplane mode
- Sensors: motion detection, environmental sensors
- Media: camera control, media playback

### Webhooks & HTTP
Event-driven webhook triggers and HTTP client for external APIs.

- Dynamic webhook endpoints at `/webhook/{path}`
- HTTP Request node with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- Webhook Response for custom responses

### Code Execution
Execute Python code directly in workflows.

- Syntax-highlighted editor with Dracula theme
- Access to `input_data` from connected nodes
- Console output capture

## Architecture Overview

MachinaOs follows n8n-inspired architectural patterns with modular backend services:

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, React Flow, Zustand |
| Backend | Python FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, LangChain |
| Real-time | WebSocket (25 message handlers) |
| WhatsApp | Go service with whatsmeow library |
| Cache | Redis (production) / SQLite (dev) / Memory fallback |
| Deployment | Docker Compose (4 containers), nginx reverse proxy |
