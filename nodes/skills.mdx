# AI Skills

Skill nodes connect to the Chat Agent's `input-skill` handle to provide domain-specific capabilities. Each skill defines instructions and allowed tools that guide the Chat Agent's behavior.

## How Skills Work

Skills are modular capabilities defined in Markdown files (SKILL.md) that follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for LLM visibility
allowed-tools: tool1 tool2
metadata:
  author: machina
  version: "1.0"
---

# Skill Instructions (Markdown)
Detailed instructions loaded when skill is activated.
```

When connected to a Chat Agent, the skill's instructions are added to the system prompt, and its allowed tools become available.

## Connecting Skills

Skills connect to the Chat Agent's **input-skill** handle (diamond shape):

```
[WhatsApp Skill] --+
                   +--(skill handle)--> [Chat Agent] --> [Output]
[Maps Skill] ------+
```

Multiple skills can be connected simultaneously.

## Combining Multiple Skills

Multiple skills can be connected to a single Chat Agent:

```
[WhatsApp Skill] --+
[Maps Skill] ------+---> [Chat Agent] --> [Output]
[HTTP Skill] ------+
```

When multiple skills are connected:
- All skill instructions are combined in the system prompt
- All allowed tools from all skills become available
- The agent can use capabilities from any connected skill

### Example Multi-Skill Workflow

```
User: "Send John my current location on WhatsApp"
Agent: [Uses Maps skill to get location]
       [Uses WhatsApp skill to send location message]
       "I've sent your current location to John on WhatsApp."
```

## Tips

<Tip>
Connect only the skills you need. Too many skills can confuse the agent.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use **Custom Skills** to create domain-specific assistants for your use case.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Skill instructions should be clear and specific about when to use each capability.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Skills require corresponding Tool nodes to be connected for their allowed-tools to work.
</Warning>
